# BetterService Default Locale File (English)
#
# This file contains default messages for BetterService operations.
# These messages are used as fallbacks when services don't define
# their own custom messages via the message() helper.
#
# To override messages for a specific namespace:
# 1. Define a namespace with messages_namespace in your service
# 2. Create locale entries under that namespace
#
# Example:
#   products:
#     services:
#       create:
#         success: "Product created successfully"
